"""Here is the class that controls the bot.

It also contains various value manipulation,
and one function that lets the bot play one round, from first roll until hold.
The intelligence is basically how many rolls the bot is going to do on one
round. The easier level on the bot rolls so many times that its statistically
is going to roll a one, the hardest level rolls lesser times to
statistically hold before theyâ€™re rolling a one.
